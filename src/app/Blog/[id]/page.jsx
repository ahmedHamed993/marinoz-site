                <p><b>1. Choose your Destination</b><br/>
                    The Red Sea is divided into two regions: the northern Red Sea and the southern Red Sea.

It also has some of the most famous dive sites in the world, such as Ras Mohammed National Park, Thistlegorm Wreck, Blue Hole and Dahab. The northern Red Sea is known for its clear water, colorful coral reefs, large schools of fish and historical wrecks.

                        <br/><b>2.  Choose your Season</b><br/>
                The Red Sea is a year-round diving destination, but the best time to visit depends on what you want to see and experience. The water temperature ranges from 20째C in winter to 30째C in summer, while the air temperature ranges from 15째C in winter to 40째C in summer. The visibility is usually excellent, ranging from 20 to 40 meters.
                The winter months (December to February) are the coldest and windiest, but also the best time to see large pelagic animals such as hammerhead sharks, whale sharks and manta rays in the southern Red Sea.
                The summer months (June to August) are the hottest and calmest, but also the best time to see coral spawning and plankton blooms in the northern Red Sea.
                The spring months (March to May) and the autumn months (September to November) are the most pleasant and balanced, with moderate temperatures, good visibility and a variety of marine life. These are also the peak seasons for tourism, so you should book your trip well in advance.

                <br/><b>3.  Choose your Accommodation</b><br/>
                There are two main options for accommodation in the Red Sea:
                Resorts or liveaboards. Resorts are land-based hotels that offer diving packages or courses along with other facilities and services. Liveaboards are boats that offer diving trips that last from a few days to a few weeks, with all meals and dives included.
                Resorts are more suitable for divers who want more comfort, flexibility and activities besides diving. They also allow you to explore the local culture, cuisine and attractions of your destination. Resorts are more common in the northern Red Sea, where there are many towns and cities along the coast.
                Liveaboards are more suitable for divers who want more adventure, immersion and dives per day. They also allow you to access more remote and diverse dive sites that are not reachable by day boats. Liveaboards are more common in the southern Red Sea, where there are fewer settlements and infrastructure along the coast.

                <br/><b>4.  Choose your Dive Sites</b><br/>

                The Red Sea has hundreds of dive sites to choose from, each with its own features and highlights. You should choose your dive sites based on your level of experience, your interests and your expectations. Here are some examples of dive sites in each region:
